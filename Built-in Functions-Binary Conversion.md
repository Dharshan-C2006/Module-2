# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```python
a=int(input())
z=bin(a)
print(z)
```

## Output

![438596169-6cdcbdd7-614c-457e-9863-c96ba9705fa9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e32a73d8-c288-4210-a0ed-e4872785cbec)



## Result

Thus,the python program was executed successfully.
